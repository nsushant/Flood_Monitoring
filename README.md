# Flood Monitoring App (V1.0) 

This python script is built using a flood monitoring API available at ([link to api](https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/reference)). The script provides you with a means to find a Station’s unique identifier and then to plot the station’s available readings. 
A user guide is available as a pdf.

## Map View 

The script allows you to view available stations (as blue dots) on a map generated using folium. This view omits stations where location data (latitude and longitude) is unavailable. Hovering and clicking on the marker of choice lets you view a station reference which you can then use to obtain plots of station data.
